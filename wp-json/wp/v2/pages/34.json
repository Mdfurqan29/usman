This means that unless you have personally guaranteed the debts, your personal assets cannot be seized to satisfy corporate debts, and you cannot be held liable for the debts.<\/li>\n<li>Registration of your company in Pakistan can increase chances for business and funding: You must have an official business registration in order to qualify for a business loan. Because once you ask for investment in a registered business, investors are more likely to take you seriously.<\/li>\n<li>Company Registration grounds you in the company and keeps you focused: Having a formal company will motivate you to devote your efforts and time to it. You may be proud of being a business owner; it&#8217;s no longer just a concept or a leisure.<\/li>\n<li>Registering a Company protects you from personal liability since your company is now a separate legal entity as a registered company. This ensures that any constitutional matters will be kept apart from your personal life.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>At, Naz Intellectuals you can also get your <a href=\"https:\/\/naz.com.pk\/trademark-registration\/\">trademark registration<\/a>, without any hassles, no matter whether you are in Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore, Multan or any other city of Pakistan.
